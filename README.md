# Elevator-Group-Control-System
This project implements an elevator group control system. An elevator group control algorithm based on the principle of minimizing the total waiting and travelling time of a passenger is developed, with outer control panels with inputs of passengers' destination floors are assumed to be used to provide necessary information for optimization. A platform for visualizing elevator group control system is developed in accordance. As long as the same variables recording the elevator states and request queues defined in the beginning of the initialization code part are used, any other algorithm can be used to replace the current algorithm implemented here.
